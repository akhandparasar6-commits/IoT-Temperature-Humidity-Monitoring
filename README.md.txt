# IoT Smart Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System 🌡️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an IoT-based Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using NodeMCU (ESP8266) and DHT11 sensor. The system collects environmental data and sends it to the cloud for real-time monitoring.

## 🎯 Objective
To design a real-time environmental monitoring system that can measure temperature and humidity and display it remotely using IoT technology.

## 🔧 Components Used
- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- WiFi Connection

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. The DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity.
2. NodeMCU reads the sensor data.
3. Using WiFi, data is transmitted to a cloud platform (ThingSpeak).
4. The user can monitor real-time values from anywhere.

## 🌐 Technologies Used
- Embedded C (Arduino IDE)
- ESP8266 WiFi Module
- ThingSpeak IoT Platform

## 📊 Applications
- Weather Monitoring Systems
- Smart Homes
- Industrial Environment Monitoring
- Server Room Monitoring

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add LCD display
- Add mobile notification alerts
- Integrate with mobile app (Blynk)
